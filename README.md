# Become-a-Citizen-Data-Scientist
Marketing Data Science is a first of a series of courses on Business Data Science. The course was constructed to be a meeting point between Marketing and Data Science. A marketing framework analysis is proposed composed of four blocs: Profiling, Segmentation, Targeting and Recommendation. For each of these blocs a Data Science analysis is applied. The pivoting question is: How to better understand your customer. Throughout the course we will use a single database to apply the different concepts and Data Science techniques. Three tools will be presented and used: SQL, Power BI and Microsoft Azure ML If you are a marketer who want to be introduced to the Data-Driven analysis field, then this course is for you. If you have a technical background (IT professional, Developer) and you inspire to become a Data Scientist, then you can take advantage of the Marketing Framework Analysis to introduce you to the business skills a has to know.
